Hero Management API


This is a FastAPI-based backend application for managing heroes, teams, and users, built with Python and SQLite. It provides a RESTful API with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting heroes and teams, as well as user registration, login, and management. The app features authentication and a modular structure, making it ideal for scalable web development projects. I developed this project to showcase my skills in Python, FastAPI, and SQLite, and Iâ€™m eager to apply these skills to freelance projects on Upwork .
